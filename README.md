# Welcome to The Otter Den!

![The Otter Den](./logo-color.png)

The Otter Den is a small and very simple flask-based online blog. Its purpose is *not* to be publicly deployed but
to serve as a pet project to learn how various aspects of software development and programming work.<br>
Further, The Otter Den will henceforth be referenced as OtterDen as this is less effort to type and it is a name
used within the code aswell.

A little bit about its history first: I started this project at the end of 2021 and began in earnest in early 2022
using a series of tutorials by [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms) I found on YouTube.<br>
While I used his great guide as a base my plan is to gradually build on top of it and experiment with different ideas
and to really flesh out what OtterDen is.

Features I have added since finishing the tutorial course include:

- Ability to upload images to posts (wip)
- Ability to switch between dark and light mode
- Dedicated profile page for individual users
- Post history page to see all posts of a user
- Set up selenium and behave testsuite to automate future testing

All of this is still heavily WIP and I will update this list if I have time.
