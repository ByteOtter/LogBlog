# Testing LogBlog with Behave

## About

LogBlog now uses the [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) testing framework to automate tests for all its features.

This is still under heavy development and this section will be expanded upon when more information is available.

## Running tests

To run the example tess already implemented:

- make sure that pip installed all of LogBlogs requirements `pip install -R requirements.txt`

- go inside the `testsuite` folder and run `behave path/of/test.feature`
