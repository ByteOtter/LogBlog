# Security Policy

> "In terms of security. - We have no security." \- Them

As already mentioned in the [README](../README.md) The Otter Den was created as a learning project<br>
therefore there was little consideration given for security. (Apart from the fact that I am still learning the basics of security.)<br>
Therefore **you will find security flaws**.

If this is the case please report them to christopher-hock@protonmail.com. <br>
However, at the core the philosophy of dealing with security bugs in The Otter Den is **"finders, keepers"**. I encourage you to submit a fix for the security flaw you found and use the PR description to explain what the flaw is and how your fix solves that issue.

### Disclaimer

I stress again that this project is **by no means meant to be used for any serious deployment**!

I cannot be held responsible for anything bad that happens to you if you ignore this warning!
